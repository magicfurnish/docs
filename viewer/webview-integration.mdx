description: "How to display MagicFurnish layouts inside your application using the galleryUrl."
---

After uploading a floor plan, the MagicFurnish API returns a `galleryUrl`.

This URL points to a hosted, interactive MagicFurnish layout experience.

All user interaction happens inside MagicFurnish after this handoff.

---

## Basic Usage

Once you receive a `galleryUrl`, open it in your application.

No additional authentication, configuration, or SDK is required.

---

## Web (iframe)

You can embed the `galleryUrl` in a standard iframe:

```html
<iframe
  src="GALLERY_URL_HERE"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
></iframe>
```

Iframe embedding is supported in web environments that allow third-party content.

Mobile (WebView)

Use your standard iOS or Android WebView component to open the galleryUrl.

Recommended settings:

JavaScript enabled

External links allowed

Optional URL Parameters

You may append optional query parameters to the galleryUrl:

tenant — apply partner-specific theming

returnUrl — display a “Back” button that returns users to your app

Example
https://app.magicfurnish.com/floor-gallery/ID?tenant=partner&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fyourapp.com

Summary

1. Upload a floor plan
2. Receive a galleryUrl
3. Open the galleryUrl in your app
