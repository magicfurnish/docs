description: "The MagicFurnish Processing API converts a raw floor plan (JPG, PNG, or single-page PDF) into a furnished, interactive layout. 

"
---

Partners upload a plan, and the API returns:

- A **unique layout ID**
- A **furnished layout image URL**
- A **MagicFurnish gallery URL** your users can open immediately

This endpoint powers all automated layout generation inside partner platforms, including SERHANT.'s S.MPLE integration.

---

## Core Workflow

1. **Upload a floor plan** using a `POST` request
2. The API validates the file
3. MagicFurnish auto-furnishes the layout
4. Final URLs are returned in the response payload
5. The partner displays or deep-links into the MagicFurnish gallery
