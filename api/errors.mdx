### Handling guidance

- **400-level validation errors:** fix the input and retry.
- **401/403:** verify credentials and permissions.
- **408:** retry with backoff; contact support if persistent.
- **413:** reduce file size or upload a smaller file.
- **415:** ensure the upload is JPG, PNG, or single-page PDF.
- **429:** slow down requests; retry after backoff.
- **500/503:** retry with backoff; contact support if persistent.
