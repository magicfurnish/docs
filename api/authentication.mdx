All MagicFurnish API requests require two authentication headers.

\`\`\`http

X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY

X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET

### Example Request

```
curl -X POST "https://app.magicfurnish.com/api/v2/ai/external/process" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -F "image=@floorplan.png"
```

### Key Management

- Keys are issued per partner environment.
- Keys can be revoked or rotated at any time.
- Store secrets securely; **never** expose them in client-side code.
- Each key is scoped to allow endpoints.

If you need additional keys for your team, contact **<u>peter@magicfurnish.com</u>**.

### Security Notice

MagicFurnish API keys and secrets are **never** included in public documentation.\
Your actual credentials are shared privately and must be stored in **server-side environment variables only**.

- Do **not** include keys in frontend code, mobile apps, or public repos
- Treat keys as passwords
- Rotate immediately if exposed

All examples on this page use **placeholder** values.

### Authentication Errors

MagicFurnish returns structured JSON errors to help diagnose issues quickly.

| Status  | Message                       | Meaning                                           |
| :------ | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **401** | `API key and secret required` | Headers missing                                   |
| **401** | `Authentication failed`       | Key or secret incorrect                           |
| **403** | `Not allowed`                 | Key is valid but not authorized for this endpoint |

If an authentication error occurs, correct the headers and retry the request.
