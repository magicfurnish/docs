All MagicFurnish API requests require two authentication headers.

\`\`\`http

X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY

X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET

## Example Request

```
curl -X POST "https://app.magicfurnish.com/api/v2/ai/external/process" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -F "image=@floorplan.png"
```

## API Key Management

- Keys are issued per partner environment (dev / staging / production)
- Keys can be revoked or rotated upon request
- Keep your API Secret secure — do not expose it client-side

If you need additional keys for your team, contact MagicFurnish Support.
