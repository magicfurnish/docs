All MagicFurnish API requests require authentication via request headers.

## Required Headers

X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET
```

## Optional Headers

X-Request-Id: demo-req-001

### Example Request

curl -X POST "https://api.magicfurnish.com/api/v2/ai/process" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -H "X-Request-Id: demo-req-001" \
  -F "image=@floorplan.png"
```

### Key Management

- Keys are issued per partner environment.
- Keys can be revoked or rotated at any time.
- Store secrets securely; **never expose them in client-side code**.
- Each key is scoped to allow endpoints.

If you need additional keys for your team, contact **<u>peter@magicfurnish.com</u>**.

### Security Notice

MagicFurnish API keys and secrets are **never** included in public documentation.\
Your actual credentials are shared privately and must be stored in **server-side environment variables only**.

- Do **not** include keys in frontend code, mobile apps, or public repos
- Treat keys as passwords
- Rotate immediately if exposed

All examples on this page use **placeholder values**.

### Authentication Errors

Authentication failures return structured JSON errors.

| Status  | Code                       | Meaning                                           |
| :------ | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **401** | unauthorized | Missing or invalid X-API-Key / X-API-Secret                                   |
| **403** | forbidden                       | Key is valid but not authorized for this endpoint |

If an authentication error occurs, correct the headers and retry the request.
