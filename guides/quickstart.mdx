## 1. Get Your API Credentials

MagicFurnish will provide you with:

- **API Key**
- **API Secret**

Store both in **server-side environment variables only**.

See **Authentication** for header details.

---

## 2. Upload a Floor Plan

Send a JPG, PNG, or single-page PDF to the Processing API.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.magicfurnish.com/api/v2/ai/process" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -H "X-Request-Id: demo-req-001" \
  -F "image=@floorplan.png"
```

If successful, you’ll receive:

- `uniqueId`
- `galleryUrl` — URL to the hosted MagicFurnish viewer
- `furnishedImageUrl` — direct image link

Full response examples are in **Upload Floor Plan**.

---

# 3. Display the Furnished Layout

Open the returned `galleryUrl` in your application.

### Web (iframe)

```
<iframe
  src="GALLERY_URL_HERE"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"
></iframe>
```

### Mobile (WebView)

Use your standard iOS/Android WebView component.\
See **Webview Integration** for examples.

---

# 4. (Optional) Add Branding & Navigation

You can append optional parameters:

- `tenant` — apply partner theming
- `returnUrl` — show a “Back” button that returns to your app

Example:

```
https://app.magicfurnish.com/floor-gallery/ID?tenant=partner&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fyourapp.com
```

---

# You’re Live

Once you can:

1. Upload a plan
2. Receive a `galleryUrl`
3. Open it in your app

…you have a complete MagicFurnish integration.

See the **Integration Flow** page for a deeper walkthrough.
