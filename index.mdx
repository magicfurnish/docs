title: "MagicFurnish API"
description: "MagicFurnish is an API that turns static floor plans into interactive, furnished layout experiences. "
---

Partners upload a floor plan image or PDF, receive a hosted MagicFurnish gallery URL, and present that experience to users inside a browser or webview.

### **How it works**

1. Upload a floor plan via the Processing API
2. MagicFurnish generates a furnished, interactive layout
3. You receive a stable `galleryUrl`
4. Open the `galleryUrl` for your users — no additional configuration required

All viewing, interaction, and layout editing happens inside MagicFurnish after this handoff.
